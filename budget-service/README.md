# Budget Service



## Getting started
Budget service helps user to add, update, view all, view by category & delete the budgets. 

## Sequence 
Once [service-registry](https://github.com/umangboriwala/user-financial-management/tree/main/service-registry) & [api-gateway](https://github.com/umangboriwala/user-financial-management/tree/main/api-gateway) services started successfully and Eureka Discovery server is up and running, run [BudgetServiceApplication.java](https://github.com/umangboriwala/user-financial-management/blob/main/budget-service/src/main/java/io/umang/project/budget_service/BudgetServiceApplication.java) file. It will get registered it-self with Eureka Service Registry.
