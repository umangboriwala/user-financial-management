# Service Registry



## Getting started
Eureka is a service registry that allows microservices to register and discover other services. It acts as a central hub that maintains a directory of all active service instances in a system. This allows microservices to communicate with each other without having to hard-code their locations or dependencies

## Sequence 
This is the first service needs to be started before any of the service.
